So in this AirBNB project I have analyzed a couple of things which I think will be useful to a property owner
Firstly I have a column chart for average price per bedroom
Then a card displaying the distinct counts of Bedroom Listings
Then a Map chart showing average Price per zipcode
and then lastly a Revenue for the year line chart!
This was a project which solely focused on developing my skills in Tableau and a light amount of data cleaning in Excel!
