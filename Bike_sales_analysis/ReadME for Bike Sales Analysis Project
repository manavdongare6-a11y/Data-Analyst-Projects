So this is a project I have created entirely in excel.
It consisted of several steps, data cleaning, data sourcing, and data visualization, it was all done in excel.
It consists of multiple charts, such as amounts of bike purchased as per region and as per occupations
What is the customer commute distance at which people of different genders are buying the bikes
what is the average income per purchase divided by genders etc
