This was a major project that I undertook with tableau which taught me a lot of its functionality and how the software works.
In this project I had to do analysis of sales and hr data, with KPIs making sure that I comparing year on year data.
This was the most complex Tableau project I had worked with so far.
It also included cleaning up the data files in excel beforehand!
